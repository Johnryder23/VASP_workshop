#Electronic relaxation
 ENCUT = 300              #specifies the cutoff energy in eV for the planewave basis set
 EDIFF = 1E-4             #electronic break condition
#NELM = 8                 #max number of electronic selfconsistency steps performed
 ALGO = Normal            #algorithm used to optimize orbitals

#Ionic relaxation
 EDIFFG = -0.001          #ionic relaxation break condition. If negative, the relaxation is stopped when the norms of all the forces are smaller than |EDIFFG|.
#NSW = 3                  #max number of ionic steps
 IBRION = 1               #determines how the ions are updated and moved
 ISYM = 0                 #symmetry treatment

#Method
 GGA = PE Â                #specifies the exchange-coorelation functional used

#Parallelisation
#NCORE =                  #determines the number of compute cores that work on an individual orbital
#KPAR = 2                 #determines the number of k-points that are to be treated in parallel
#NSIM = 10                 #sets the number of bands that are optimized simultaneously by the RMM-DIIS algorithm
