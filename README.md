This repository hosts the content of the 'Using resources effectively with VASP: exploring GPU and machine learning capability' workshop run by NeSI.

Following instructions are for maintainers only, not for attendees.

First, install [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and other dependencies in a Python virtual environment:

## Getting started
```
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once your virtual environment is ready, compile a local version of the workshop material using:

```
mkdocs serve
```

and open your web browser at the address returned by the command.
